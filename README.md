Passionate about automating infrastructure, building efficient CI/CD pipelines, and deploying scalable cloud-native solutions.
🎯 Currently focused on landing a Cloud DevOps role where I can build, break, and improve things in production!
When I’m not coding or learning, you’ll find me enjoying books, spa days, good movies, and delicious food.  
I’m always open to collaborating on exciting DevOps projects — feel free to reach out!
